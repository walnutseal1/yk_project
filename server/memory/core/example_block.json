Also, user started communicating with me today, 2025-08-24 08:26:02 PM UTC+0000. User seems confused or sarcastic - should clarify if they meant my code or something else. Also, I need to confirm that I am the one who wrote the code they're referring to, as they seem to think it's not mine. Need to explain what Claude AI is to user.",
